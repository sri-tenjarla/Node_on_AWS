# This Project showcases Node.js Concepts:

    1. Multi threading using worker_threads - To avoid blocking of the execution and handling opeations asynchronously, with the help of multi threading in Node.js.
    2. Streams -
        Advantages: 1) Memory efficiency, 2) Faster processing, 3) Non-blocking, 4) data encryption. By leveraging streams, you can build applications that are both efficient and responsive, capable of handling large amounts of data seamlessly.

        2.1. Readable streams
        2.2. Writable streams
        2.3. Duplex streams
        2.4. Transform streams
